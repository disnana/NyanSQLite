POC: BUG-02 — get_db_size() raises FileNotFoundError for :memory: databases

Before the patch, NanaSQLite(":memory:").get_db_size() delegates directly to
os.path.getsize(":memory:"), which raises FileNotFoundError because ":memory:"
is not a real file path — it is SQLite's sentinel for an in-memory database.

After the patch, get_db_size() detects the ":memory:" path and returns 0.
