POC: SEC-01 — ORDER BY subquery injection (v1.5.5 pre-patch)

Demonstrates that the ORDER BY clause character-whitelist validation
permits parentheses and alphanumeric characters, which is sufficient to
construct a boolean-based blind SQL injection payload such as:

    ORDER BY (SELECT CASE WHEN 1=1 THEN name ELSE age END)

SELECT is not listed in _DANGEROUS_SQL_RE (which only covers DDL keywords),
so the expression passes all pre-patch validation and is forwarded verbatim
to SQLite when strict_sql_validation=False (the default).

After the patch, _ORDERBY_SUBQUERY_KEYWORDS_RE detects SELECT/FROM/JOIN/…
and raises ValueError / issues UserWarning accordingly.
